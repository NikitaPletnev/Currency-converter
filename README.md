Hi

In general, I completed the task, wrote everything in typescript. 

Perhaps there are small errors and shortcomings somewhere. 

I didnâ€™t have time to do integration tests. 

I tried to do it qualitatively 
I tried to do it with animations 
I think it turned out quite well perhaps the lack of testing is not enough but t
he project is non-commercial and the test task here 
there is no time for testing and removing any minor flaws
 but I seem to have checked everything should work well 
 on all devices and should not cause problems with compilation.
